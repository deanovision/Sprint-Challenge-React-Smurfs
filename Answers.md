1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    server-side routing takes place when a user makes a request and the information requested is served from the server and then rendered to the screen.

    client-side routing takes place when the information is pre loaded into the browser and served from there. this way the page doesn't have to reload each time a new request is made and only information required is updated.
